14,Knuckles Chaotix,"<Paragraph text=""Anyone who knows anything about SEGA, knows about Sonic the Hedgehog, and vice-versa. Sonic and SEGA have become as synonymous as Nintendo and Mario, or Atari and Mexican landfills. While the first 3 (technically 4) Sonic games and Sonic CD are remembered fondly, few either remember or care for SEGA's other sonic platformer on the SEGA 32x, <FireText text='Knuckles Chaotix'/>, introducing a new cast of characters, and Knuckles is there too."" /><Paragraph text=""This game is known for its new rubber band mechanic where two characters are connected together and have to use it's weird, at times broken physics, to go fast. But is this game bad? Is it worth forgetting? Or is it a hidden gem in the SEGA 32x library (however small it is)? For the price it goes for online now, HELL NO. Just emulate it, even though I bought it anyway…"" /><TitleCard title=""Knock Knock!"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/KnucklesC.png"" /><Quote quote=""Unlike Sonic I don't chuckle. I'd rather flex my muscles"" source=""-Unknown from M.E., Sonic Adventure"" /><Paragraph text=""The beginning of Chaotix's development goes back to a Genesis tech demo known as Sonic Crackers, which is also believed to be a mistranslation of Sonic Clackers. This demo included the ring tether mechanic that Chaotix is famous for. This involves two characters being attached together with a magic trail that acts as a rubber band, and requires you to use the, often broken, physics to gain more speed."" /><Paragraph text=""Originally, this game was meant to be released on the SEGA Saturn, as the next Sonic game, but was moved to the 32x. It eventually became clear that the game would not be ready in time for the Saturn's launch. That and they needed more games for the 32x, because at the time they didn't have many games for the addon, and even now there's only about 40 games counting 32x CD and region locked games. According to an interview with <ThunderText text='Tom'/> <ThunderText text='Kalinske'/>, CEO of Sega of America during 1990 to 1996, the game was too large and behind schedule, and was downgraded when being brought over to the 32x, which explains a lot."" /><Picture imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/SonicCrackers.png"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" /><Paragraph text=""Sonic and Tails were removed from the game by 1994, and Knuckles was made the star of the show. It's believed this decision was due to SEGA's fear of the 32x failing and damaging Sonic's brand, which it was doomed to fail, but who knows what that would have done to Sonic. Besides the <strong>‘tougher than leather'</strong> red echidna on the box art, we also got the new arrivals Vector the crocodile, Charmy bee, Mighty the armadillo, and Espio the chameleon. With Mighty originating in the Sega Sonic arcade game, and Vector and Charmy's designs being taken from early concept art, that makes Espio the only original character besides  Heavy and Bomb of whom we shall forget."" /><Paragraph text=""One may guess that the developers of Chaotix was Sonic Team, who was responsible for the other Sonic games that came before this. Well it turns out it was developed by another team of devs at SEGA. My assumption would be that they wanted their best team to work on projects they had faith in like Sonic Xtreme, because that went well right?"" /><TitleCard title=""The rings bind us"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/MetalSonicC.png"" /><Quote quote=""Rats..."" source=""-Knuckles, Sonic Adventure 2"" /><Picture imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixTitle.png"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" /><Paragraph text=""Starting up the game, we are treated to an intro with Metal Sonic and some city surrounded by some weird purple/blue ground <em>(32x word I assume?)</em>. Starting up a new game gives us control of Knuckles and immediately you may notice that <strong>C</strong> is the only jump button, unlike previous games. Running left, you'll find Dr. Robotnik and Espio trapped in a capsule. Freeing him binds the two characters with some magic rings. Robotnik is carried away by Metal Sonic, and the tutorial starts. Pro tip, skip the tutorial, it's followed by, what is essentially, another unskippable tutorial. Playing either tutorial you will find that <strong>B</strong> allows you to keep your partner still, or pick up and throw them, while <strong>A</strong> lets you teleport them to your location for 10 rings. You can even go into Negative rings using this!"" /><Paragraph text=""Collecting 50 rings will cause a giant ring to appear at the end of the stage and send you to a special stage. The special stages in this game involve running forward through 3d environments collecting Rings for extra time, and a required amount of blue spheres. Unfortunately there's no chaos emeralds this time around, instead, we got <FireText text='chaos'/> <FireText text='rings!'/> What do they do? Nothing, new ending, that's it, it's pretty cool at least. Once you're finally done with the tutorial, you can choose from one of the 5 available characters, and get on to the main game."" /><Paragraph text=""<em>Well…</em> after you play a crane game to grab your second character. The other 4 characters, as well as Heavy and Bomb, can be grabbed here, but you better hope you get lucky and grab the one you want. There is an item you can grab in bonus stages, which are different from the special stages, that allow you to choose whoever you want. These stages can be found in giant rings hidden in each stage, and they involve falling down an infinite tunnel grabbing rings and points, while avoiding obstacles. They end when you hit an exit or run out of rings. Once you've got your partner, the level you go to is chosen randomly, similarly to the crane game. You can also find an item for choosing the next level in bonus stages as well. After all that, <strong>NOW</strong> you start the game."" /><TitleCard title=""Chaos, no ticks"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/VectorC.png"" /><Quote quote=""Darn, I forgot to pay the electric bill for the office"" source=""-Vector, Sonic Heroes"" /><Picture imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixCombi.png"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" /><Paragraph text=""Starting off in the randomly chosen level, you'll notice the great music, low number of enemies, repetitive level design, and lots of colours <em>(unless you're in Amazing Arena that is)</em> that all the levels have to offer. The enemies in the zone depend on the time of day in game, which changes every two levels. This also changes the colour palette of the level and, while this is clearly an attempt to flex the power of the 32x, it's pretty cool in this humble opinion of mine. The 5 zones, with 5 acts each are, Botanic Base, Marina Madness Techno Tower, Speed Slider, and Amazing Arena. Most of these zones have nothing special to them, but let's go through them anyway!"" /><Paragraph text=""Botanic Base is a giant greenhouse filled with plant themed enemies, and fills the <EarthText text='nature' /> <EarthText text='stage' /> requirement of the classic games <em>(Emerald Hill, Palmtree Panic etc)</em>. Marina Madness, a water themed level with no water sections <em>(probably for the best)</em>, that has boats that bring you to lower sections of the game. Techno Tower, a more vertical level with billboards that hide secrets. Speed Slider, the fastest level in the game with a carnival theme, and some cool tricks you can pull off by accident. Last and probably least, Amazing Arena, a dark and foreboding level that gets more colourful when you flick a light switch, and includes a miniboss that gets harder depending on the time of day."" /><Paragraph text=""There's not a lot I have to say about the individual stages, they don't really have that much that separates them, besides aesthetic and slightly different level design. All zones have 5 acts, and for the life of me, I can't recall any notable differences between them. This doesn't detract from the fact that these stages are all fun to go through, and the physics of the rubber band mechanic allows for incredible speeds and tricks that feel awesome to pull off! The main detractor of the stages are the slow automatic sections that happen frequently. Elevators in Botanic Base, ships in Marina Madness, ufos in Amazing Arena etc. These require you to wait for your partner to teleport to you, then take a slow ride to a different section of the level. Not terrible on their own, but it happens too frequently."" /><Paragraph text=""Running through the levels with the different characters is fun, but you quickly notice they all are fundamentally the same. Knuckles can glide and climb walls, Espio can run on walls and ceilings, Mighty can cling to walls and wall jump, Vector can dash in any direction and climb on walls, and Charmy can just fly infinitely. While they look distinct, there isn't any area you need one character's ability for, anyone can go anywhere. There's also a good amount of item boxes compared to previous games with new items as well:"" /><ul><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixRingBox.png"" content=""Standard ring box, gives 10 rings when broken"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixBlueRing.png"" content=""Drops large rings when hit instead of all individual rings"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixCharBox.png"" content=""Swaps to a different character temporarily"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixShrink.png"" content=""Shrinks a characer, lowering their jump and speed"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixGrow.png"" content=""Makes a character grow huge and have increased jump height"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixSwap.png"" content=""Swaps player's control to the second character temporarily"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixInvin.png"" content=""Temporary invincibility"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixShield.png"" content=""Gives a shield that protects against one hit"" /><ListItem imgSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixSpeed.png"" content=""Temporary boost of speed"" /></ul><Picture imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/ChaotixTower.png"" pageColour=""#FD483C"" /><Paragraph text=""Like the previous Sonic games, the final act of each level ends with a boss and, honestly, all the bosses besides the final two are pretty forgettable. There's one on a carousel, one with a 3D shield, one that grabs your partner and requires you to swing around and hit Robotnik. The real fight starts after all 25 levels are beaten, and you return to the level select, only to find <ThunderText text='Metal'/> <ThunderText text='Sonic'/>. He attaches himself to the level select device thing, and the options change from the 5 zones, to 4 numbers and one <strong>X</strong>. Hitting one of the 4 numbers will have the device unleash a different attack on you, and hitting the <strong>X</strong> will remove one of the attacks. Hit <strong>X</strong> 4 times and that's it. This fight takes a bit of luck if you want it done fast, but is a nice change of pace from the other bosses and is pretty creative compared to them as well."" /><Paragraph text=""Once Metal Sonic is defeated, the floor collapses, and Dr. Robotnik uses the power of the <strong>Dark Ring™</strong> to power up Metal Sonic <em>(I think)</em>, and now comes the final boss, <FireText text='World'/> <FireText text='Entrance'/> <FireText text='Level'/> <FireText text='2'/>! Or Metal Sonic Kai, whichever you prefer. The first phase has you attack his right arm until it breaks. The second phase, Metal Sonic will move into the background and attempt to slap you, and you just have to destroy his other arm. Finally, phase 3 has you hitting his body, while he occasionally fires a laser, and that's it. Honestly, a pretty easy fight, but the presentation is great, and <strong>Oriental Legend</strong> is a great boss theme. Now this is where the Chaos rings come into play, if you get them all, Sonic and Tails appear in the credits, yay!

Needless to say, this game didn't sell well, not just because of the mixed reception, but being a 32x game doomed it from the start. While the bosses are underwhelming, and the game overall is pretty easy, the rubber band mechanic, special stages, and fast paced gameplay make this game just pure fun to run around in. By throwing your partner into the air, you can have them pull you into the air, grab them and repeat, and you can basically fly!"" /><Paragraph text=""Nowadays, Knuckles Chaotix goes for insane prices online, and has never been released anywhere since. I'd still recommend playing it though if you can find a good emulator. If you've got any thoughts on this game, article, or are stranded on mars, the comments exist for a reason!"" />"
6,Cosmic Carnage,"<Paragraph text='To many people who hear the words SEGA and Fighting together, many would jump to the Virtua Fighter series, Eternal champions, or say “Oh yeah, da Sonic people!”. But if you jump to this game as your first example, then I have a few questions. That’s not to say I dislike the game in question, I believe Cosmic Carnage is a great hidden gem in the 32Xlibrary and in SEGA’s history, but it is far from perfect.' pageColour='#DDDD44'/> <Paragraph text=""With beautiful character designs and animations but slow sluggish controls, an amazingsoundtrack but an almost non-existent development history, there is a lot here I want to talk about, so let's dive into Cosmic Carnage for the Sega Genesis 32X."" /> <Picture imageSrc='https://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/Cosmic%20Title.png' pageColour='#DDDD44'/> <TitleCard title='32-Bit Beginnings' pageColour='#DDDD44' imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/Cosmic Cylic.png""/> <Paragraph text=""During the console wars of the 16-bit era, SEGA had released their console, the SEGA Genesis, in August of 1989 to massive success. Later on they released an add-on for the console, theSEGA CD in October of 1992, in an attempt to cash in on cd’s which had more storage capacity and better audio quality than standard cartridges. Unfortunately the CD did not perform aswell as they hoped, selling only 2.24 million units, so they decided “Fuck it let’s make another add-on” in 1994. The new add-on, the SEGA 32X, was made to be a cheaper option for people who owned a Genesis but did not have the funds to purchase the new and cool Saturn. But every console needs to have launch games, enter Cosmic Carnage."" /> <Paragraph text=""There isn’t much to say about this game’s development history. It was developed by Almanic Corporation, in conjunction with ALU, and then published as a 32X exclusive by SEGA. The developers got their kits only 3 months before the games release date. They only had 3 months to build a launch title for a new console. SEGA didn’t even want to ship the game in the state it was in, butdid anyway. I feel this is a good example of SEGA releasing something too early and not giving the devs enough time to polish everything out. Another good example of this would be Sonic 2006, a game riddled with bugs, terrible graphics and animation, and painfully long loading times. What could Cosmic Carnage have been with just a bit more time, who knows."" /> <Paragraph text=""I’d love to talk more about the dev team here, but unfortunately there really isn’t anything about them online. The credit’s don’t list anyone’s position on the team other than special thanks. The only notable names I could dig up were from the project’s programmer, Takashi Shichijo, and composer, Hikoshi Hashimoto. Takashi has worked on the design of other games such as InuYasha: The Secret of the Cursed Mask and Shien's Revenge. Interestingly, his page on MobyGames shows that Cosmic Carnage is his only role in programming/engineering. Hikoshi Hashimoto on the other hand has had history with SEGA before Cosmic Carnage. He worked many SEGA games before such as Racing hero and Power Rangers. Unfortunately I couldn’t find much more information about his role in the project, much like everyone else in the credits. That just about covers what I found of the development, but what about the game itself?"" /> <TitleCard title='Intergalactic Prison Break' pageColour='#DDDD44' imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/Cosmic Deamon.png""/> <Picture imageSrc='https://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/Cosmic%20Prison.png' pageColour='#DDDD44' /> <Quote quote='Let the carnage begin' source='-Cosmic Carnage'/> <Paragraph text='Cosmic Carnage plays like any other traditional 2D-fighter like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter 2 or Eternal Champions. You choose a character with their own quirks and special moves and duke it out with an AI or another player. For the most part it doesn’t do anything new however, 4 of the8 characters in question have a mechanic where you can swap between heavy and light armor pieces. There are 3 pieces per set and swapping between them will affect that character’s stats and special moves. The downside to this is that the armor can be broken in battle and if that happens, you will not only be weaker, but you will lose the special move tied to that armor piece. I think this is an awesome mechanic to have, it makes you carefully balance special moves and stats, or just go with one of the other 4 characters without this mechanic.' /> <Paragraph text='While this all sounds good, the game will significantly slow down at times, usually whenever you use a special attack. Also speaking of special attacks, they feel impossible to pull off at times. I’m not the best at Street Fighter, but I can still consistently pull off a Haduken, not here. Maybe it’s just me, but it’s especially annoying for moves thatrequire the taunt buttons, because failing them leaves you wide open for being countered. Besides that, you can also sort of use fatalities. By finishing off your opponent with a special move in the last round, you will either slice them in half, cut their arms off, or blow up their head. It ain’t much, but it’s something. One really weird thing about the characters though is that they will use the second color palette regardless of whether or not 2 of the same characters have been selected. So Naja will always be purple in single player if she’s your opponent.' /> <Underline /> <Paragraph text='The characters in Cosmic Carnage are split between two factions, a band of prisoners who have escaped, and a group of military soldiers who responded to a false distress beacon the prisoners sent out. The prisoners tried to hijack the new ship but ended up wrecking it to the point where it shall soon explode, and there is only one escape pod left. Now they must fight before the timer runs out for their own survival. The plot’s pretty solid I’d say, I mean it’s a fighting game, I don’t need a reason to fight, as long as I can stylishly tear the limbs off my opponents with my bare hands, I’m good.' /> <Paragraph text='Besides the plot, this game also has very nice sprite work. The backgrounds are detailed and range from the asteroid belt to a giant elevator to many different views of space. All the shots of space are colourful and detailed and some backgrounds, such asthe elevator, are animated beautifully as well. The cast of this game looks awesome as well. All the characters are made up of multiple parts all animated separately, and each armor piece has separate animations as well. The character’s armor also changes colour depending on which pieces you choose which I think is awesome. But this is also the 32X, and you can’t go two seconds without some forced in sprite scaling effects. For some attacks that get close up to the screen, such as Naruto’s sword, the sprites will be upscaled to give off a sudo-3D effect. Like it or hate, I think this is a pretty cool addition, although more people seem to hate it.' /> <Paragraph text='One thing people seem to agree on though is how beautiful the soundtrack is. So many great pieces composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto. I’ll leave a link to the soundtrack on VintaGamers Paradise <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-vD6rIjXrcI4WtmwBwf5USskGS-s2PFj"">here</a>.

What Ryu is to Street Fighter, I’d say Cylic is the same forCosmic Carnage. He’s the first character who is highlighted in the menu and he even has a hadouken!

The end result, NiGHTS, was made to be very different from Sonic. To start, the themes of the dream world were inspired from the works of Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Holtz, and Carl Yung, mainly his theory on anima and animus. Apparently, Takashi Iizuka, the game’s lead designer, had put so much research into the theories, that Yuji Naka would request him to interpret his dreams. It’s also worth noting that Dreams were not the only theme that Sonic team considered, other themes included adventure and military.

They also threw around the idea of 2D anime cutscenes for the game, but went with cg as they felt there would be less resilience to it (although I think most people would have preferred animated cutscenes instead).' /><Paragraph text='Development of NiGHTS was not easy for the team. At the time, the Saturn was still new and notably harder to develop for than the Playstation. According to Sonic Team, many parts of the code were re-written multiple times, five to ten sometimes. I know that sometimes you gotta just start from scratch again but good lord that sounds obnoxious. Luckily, Yuji Naka had been learning about saturn programming since 1994, so they weren’t completely in the dark when it came to the console. Naka’s work on NiGHTS was considered to be one of the most complex projects on the Saturn. Sonic Team was able to successfully create a game with impressive 3D graphics and 2D side scrolling gameplay, but something wasn’t quite right…' /><Paragraph text='While NiGHTs was fun to play, and had plenty of replayability (for the time), the team noticed that the Saturn’s d-pad wasn’t cutting it for smooth controls. They decided to attempt using other control methods to see if any of them worked better. They made many prototype controllers, around 100 were designed, arranging from remotes, flight sticks, and apparently a NiGHTs shaped doll? Eventually, they settled on the Sega Saturn 3D Control Pad (thank god). With more responsive analog control at their hands, they were able to design the levels around it. NiGHTs is still completely playable with the normal Saturn controller, however the 3D Control Pad is leagues better to use.' /><Paragraph text=""Interestingly enough, the first person they got to use the controller, was none other than Stephen Spielberg himself! He played the game on an early version of the controller and since then, it’s been known as the Spielberg Controller. They knew that the best NiGHTs experience was with this controller, so they bundled it with the game itself on release. Not much else to say about the development, NiGHT’s colour scheme was meant to defy the idea that purple wasn’t a marketable colour, and voices were recorded in house by Sonic Team members. But now that we’ve covered the development, what about the game itself?"" /><TitleCard title='Growing Wings' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Picture imageSrc='https://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/NightsCanyon.png' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Quote quote=""I thought the time attack style was fun.

Flying through rings, collecting 20 blue orbs, and using them to break a container. Each level (Night) has four laps (Mares), and once completed ends with a boss fight. The main gameplay of NiGHTS is pretty basic overall, each level has some gimmick associated with it, sometimes being a first person section where NiGHTs transforms. Every lap of a level has a time limit and failing to finish the lap will have you playing as one of the other main characters, Claris or Elliot. Gameplay with them revolves around running on the ground and collecting blue orbs and breaking the container at the end of the lap before being caught by a floating egg timer that will wake you up. In total there are 7 levels, 3 for each character and 1 final level that can be played with either of them once their individual levels are complete.' /><Paragraph text='Claris and Elliot both enter Nightopia for different but similar reasons. Claris had stage fright and Elliot lost a basketball game at school, and this puts them on the radar of Wizeman the Wicked and his army of Nightmaren. Wizeman in the western game is a god who rules over the nightmare world, and in the japanese version he is a human deprived of Ideya, dream energy. In both versions, Wizeman plans to create an army to steal the Ideya of visitors, other humans who enter Nightopia, and open a portal to the real world so he can rule that world as well.' /><Picture imageSrc='https://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/NightsGulpo.png' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Paragraph text='Nightmaren come in 3 levels, the basic enemies you find in levels with no free will, level 3, the bosses that have their own personalities and are far stronger, but still serve Wizeman without question, level 2, and the highest level NiGHTS and Reala. Both characters have free will and have enough strength to rival Wizeman, but while Reala remains loyal to his creator, NiGHTS decides to disobey and help the visitors and Nightopians. Every level begins with NiGHTS trapped in an Ideya palace by Reala, and the visitor loses all but one of their Ideya, allowing them to enter the palace and fuse with NiGHTS for some reason, allowing them to reclaim the missing Ideya in each level before Wizeman can use them.' /><Paragraph text='t’s also worth noting that one of the bosses, Jackle, was made to be a first level Nightmaren, but Wizeman messed up and is now a second level. I don’t know, I find that interesting. Not counting the final level, the six levels are, Splash Garden, with a beach setting, an underwater cavern section, and where the boss Puffy is faced. Spring Valley, an area with grassy mountains, a large tree, and is haunted by the boss Gillwing. Frozen bell, covered in snow, home to the only train station (maybe) in Nightopia, and where Clawz is fought. Mystic Forest, with dense trees, road signs, a temple, and home to Gulpo. Soft Museum where everything feels like it’s made of rubber and where the Jackal finally makes his appearance. Lastly there is Stick Canyon, a desert level filled with many strange gadgets and where NiGHTS and Reala finally face off.' /><TitleCard title='Beadichinoa NiGHTS!' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Picture imageSrc='https://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/NightsReala.png' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Quote quote=""I'll deliver your heads to Master Wizeman myself!"" source='-Reala, NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams'/><Paragraph text='After completing all of a character’s individual levels, that character can then enter the final level, Twin Seeds, the hometown of our main characters. Originally, this level was supposed to be exclusive to Elliot, and Claris was supposed to have her own level. It starts out like the other levels with your chosen character walking up to the Ideya palace to free NiGHTs, but then Wizeman.png pushes you to a distant island with nothing but the red Ideya. With no other option you jump off the island, and your courage gives you the ability to fly like NiGHTS! However even with this new ability, you only have 3 minutes to grab the other Ideya, free NiGHTS and complete the level.' /><Paragraph text='Once the Ideya are collected, Elliot and Claris combine their power to free NiGHTS from Wizeman’s grasp. They then both fuse with NiGHTS separately (somehow) and Wizeman appears behind. The final battle ensues as Wizeman uses his abilities to throw fireballs, meteors, snow, and tornados at NiGHTS. But his efforts prove ineffective as the combined power of NiGHTS, Elliot, and Claris combined are enough to put an end to Wizeman’s wrath. Afterwards, our protagonists remember they have a life outside of fighting interdimensional dream gods and set out to face the challenges in their real lives. Elliot stands up to his bullies and beats them in a game of basketball, and Claris works up the courage needed for her audition, and gets the part. Happy ending, Wizeman gone for good, no more Reala, THE END' /><Paragraph text='Well, that’s what Yuji Naka would have liked but after he left SEGA to found Prope, NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams was released a year later to less appeal than the original game. That game, while featuring the return of NiGHTS, Reala and Wizeman, the main characters were two new kids, and the other Nightmaren such as Jackle didn’t return either. One last thing I’ve yet to mention is the A-Life system. In each level of the game, besides Twin Seeds, you can find Nightopians roaming around the level. You can hatch new ones from eggs, make them happier by killing enemies, or make them sadder by attacking and killing them. None of this has any real effect on the gameplay, but the music will change depending on their mood. Enemies you kill also turn into orbs that bounce around, and if an orb comes into contact with a Nightopian, they lay an egg that hatches into a Mepian, a Nightopian with a part of a Nightmaren’s body. While interesting, they may end up bullying the other Nightopians but, if two Mepians with only one Nightmaren part breed, they create a King Pian, who will build a castle and throw rocks at enemies. Keep in mind, all this happens in the background as you fly through the levels.' /><TitleCard title='Night Over' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Picture imageSrc='https://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/NightsEnding.png' pageColour='#A600FF'/><Quote quote=""In the nights...

Overall I loved this game, mostly for the themes and world they built, but the gameplay is fast and going for the best rank is fun. However, once Wizeman is defeated, there isn’t much reason to go back to this other than high scores and the A-life system. It sucks, because the core gameplay of flying through hoops and gathering blue orbs is fun, but the only really replayable mode is multiplayer where two players control NiGHTS and Reala and duke it out.' /><Paragraph text='Regardless, NiGHTS is still a great game to this day, considered one of the best Saturn games ever, and a remaster with the original version is available for $9 CAD on steam. I recommend playing that version, with a controller, rather than hunting down an original copy and Saturn. Unlike me who payed to much for a complete copy to play on his Saturn with a failing laser… heh.' />"
16,Friday the 13th NES,"<Paragraph text=""The survival horror genre is not one I've dived very deep into myself, but when brought up in conversation, the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> and <strong>Silent Hill</strong> series are usually the 2 that everyone brings up, for good reason.

While I'm sure it needs no introduction, <strong>LJN</strong> was an American toy company, known for releasing figures based off of recognisable brands. They eventually expanded to the video game market, gathering licenses for recognisable brands to create games."" /><Paragraph text=""While <strong>LJN</strong> got the license for Friday the 13th, the game was developed by <FireText text='Atlus'/>! Yeah, the same Atlus that developed <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong> and <strong>Persona</strong>! Phantom thief Jason when?"" /><Paragraph text=""Info on development is sparse, but according to <a href='https://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/friday-the-13th/credits'>this page on MobyGames</a>, there were only 4 developers.

For starters, the map has a few notable changes. The cabins and paths are now marked, and there is an area of the map not seen in the final version. While the cabin/path marking is nice, the extra area seems interesting. It looks to be an open area with lots of campfires? Who knows what would've been there, but one other notable detail is that the cabins on the lake are missing. I guess that would render the lake as nothing more than a shortcut."" /><Paragraph text=""While there may be no cabins at the lake, there is an image of a character on a boat, with a cabin and npc in the background. Mayhaps this cabin was not meant to stay in the background and not be interactable? However, the npc is interesting. Once again, this may have just been another background object, but given the other screenshot still has the number of living kids, maybe they were supposed to be scattered around the camp rather than all stuck in one cabin? Just theorising, it's all we got!"" /><Paragraph text=""Last thing to mention about the promo, is the image of <strong>Jason</strong> in the cabin. He looks far different than his final version, a smaller health bar, more detail, a different pose, and of course, the correct colour palette. It's assumed that the purple colour scheme of the final build is due to the Japanese poster for <strong>Friday the 13th Part 3</strong> having a purple Jason on it, and purple representing evil in Japan, but according to this promo material, <em>somebody somewhere</em> knew the correct colour palette?

We pick a character and are told to light fireplaces with a torch. <strong>Issue #1</strong>, you use a lighter on the fireplaces. Moving on from that, we start outside a cabin, with zombies rising from the ground, nothing to defend ourselves with, but a <FireText text='rock'/> that flies over enemies. <strong>Issue #2</strong>, while you can just duck to make the rock's arc more accurate, the fact that it is basically a requirement to make the weapon work is not good in my opinion."" /><Paragraph text=""Once you've killed a few zombies<em>(apparently)</em>, a lighter will spawn and picking it up will allow you to pick up other items, such as a knife, vitamins, and keys. These items spawn by jumping around and can only be picked up by jumping into them. While you're doing this, you'll most likely hear an alarm go off. A timer counting down will appear next to the children or the counselor counter, and the cabin that Jason's in will be marked on the map. If you don't make it in time, Jason will kill either one counselor, or 5 kids."" /><Paragraph text=""When you make it into the cabin, you'll have to look around to run into <EarthText text='Jason'/>, and when you find him, you'll need to fend him off. Jason will move around the screen and attempt to punch the player. You can attack by throwing your weapon and dodge by hitting diagonally down on the d-pad.

It spawns either in a cabin after lighting a bunch of fireplaces, or reading a note that leads you to another note in a cabin in the woods, and then, with no indication, going back to the first cabin and picking it up."" /><Paragraph text=""So let's say the player does pick it up, they may also miss out on one important secret. In the cave, walk left onto the second platform, around the left edge should be an invisible door that you could see with the flashlight. Use a key to unlock it and start a secret fight with the floating head of <strong>Pamela Voorhees</strong>. Killing her on the first day gives you a machete, but killing her on the second day gives you her sweater, which makes you take half damage from Jason. Killing her on the third day gives you a pitchfork, which is slightly better than the torch, but not enough to justify getting it as Pamela gets more aggressive each day."" /><Paragraph text=""Also, <strong>issue #4</strong>, why does the game make the fireplaces seem so important? Lighting all the fireplaces only nets you a flashlight that can show you secret doors in the cave, and on top of that, you still need a key to get to the secret fight. Unsuspecting players will believe that the goal of the game is to light the fireplaces, and Jason is so powerful, players may not believe you can even defeat him yet<em>(not entirely wrong)</em>."" /><TitleCard title='Fire will damage' imageSrc='http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/cabinnes.png' pageColour='#178700' /><Quote quote=""Jason the most "" source=""Note, Friday the 13th NES"" /><Picture imageSrc=""http://files.ninjabattler.ca/image/fridaynote.png"" pageColour=""#178700""/><Paragraph text=""So I've been pretty negative so far, but while this game can be confusing, it's pretty enjoyable once you know how it works, and how to obtain the torch and sweater. Your first priority should be getting the torch, as one hit from it will take out one bar of Jason's health, while something like the rock takes 3 or 4 hits to do that. On day 2, you will also want to grab the sweater from Pamela for the extra defense. The last items you'll want are the vitamins, as they will heal you slightly, and revive you when you die. These can be found along trails and the woods/cave."" /><Paragraph text=""Once you grab the torch on the first day, Jason should fall easily with some skilled dodging. After you grab the sweater on the second day, it should be the same thing except Jason will be harder to dodge. On the third day, don't try fighting him in the cabins, he will be too fast to reliably dodge. Instead, you can find Jason outside and fight him there and spam the torch to take him out quickly. Jason has a different set path each day so when you figure that out, it should be easy to track him down."" /><Paragraph text=""With enough vitamins, dodging, and chasing him down, Jason will fall. <EarthText text='OR'/> <EarthText text='DOES'/> <EarthText text='HE?'/> Regardless, the day is saved until Jason returns, then goes to hell, then comes back, then goes to space.

13,Reading emails with IMAP,"<Paragraph text='With apps such as Discord and Slack for sending messages, or Google Drive for sharing files, Email is still widely used for communication, and sending files occasionally. Nowadays, larger files would normally be shared by a separate service such as Google Drive, but emails can still contain smaller files such as PDFs or other important information. Would it not be nice to be able to filter through all your emails, download all attachments, or whatever else you can think of? No? You’d rather just use Discord? Huh…' /><Paragraph text='If you’re still here then I guess that means you’re interested then. I’ll be using Node Js and a package for IMAP to read emails and download their attachments. I will also be using a gmail account and the gmail IMAP server as an example, but any other server should work so long as you have an account that is compatible with it. So… let’s rush into reading emails and downloading attachments with Imap.' /><TitleCard title='What Map?' pageColour='#9F261C' /><Paragraph text=""So I think it may be good to start out with an explanation of IMAP and it's older counterpart, POP. IMAP(Internet Message Access Protocol) is an internet protocol used to retrieve data from an email server. IMAP was created in 1986 and developed by Mark Cripson, during his time at the Stanford Knowledge Systems Laboratory. Imap has gone through multiple versions, currently sitting at IMAP4. The purpose of IMAP’s creation was to improve upon POP(Post Office Protocol), which was the email protocol at the time. Nowadays both IMAP and POP coexist, but IMAP still has some advantages over POP, namely:"" /><ul><ListItem content='IMAP4 stays connected and downloads new messages as long as the client is open, whereas POP will download messages on one request and save them locally.' pageColour='#9F261C' /><ListItem content='Multiple clients can be connected to one mailbox at the same time with IMAP, whereas POP only allows one client at a time.' pageColour='#9F261C' /><ListItem content='IMAP allows users to download specific MIME pieces of an email such as only the text and no file attachments' pageColour='#9F261C' /><ListItem content='IMAP can attach and read flags on messages, telling it the state of the message such as being read, replied to etc.' pageColour='#9F261C' /><ListItem content='IMAP has access to viewing and modifying multiple mailboxes for email.' pageColour='#9F261C' /></ul><Paragraph text='Even with these advantages, POP still has some advantages over IMAP. Some may complain that IMAP’s advantages and features make it too complicated and unnecessary for just simply grabbing emails. POP also saves all the pulled messages locally, making it easier and faster to view older messages rather than having to reconnect with IMAP. Even with these complexities, I’ve chosen IMAP because the features it has gives us better options for grabbing data from an email server (and I have some experience using IMAP and Node JS but let’s ignore that shall we).' /><TitleCard title='Mapping it out' pageColour='#9F261C' /><Paragraph text=""Aight, let’s start this by downloading this <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/imap'>package</a> for Node JS, created by <b>mscdex</b> on GitHub, and the <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv'>Dotenv package</a> to store your credentials in a .env file. To start, let’s just get connected to an email client. I’ll be using gmail for this example, but any mail provider should work as long as you know their host and port, and have an account to use. Most hosts will use port 143 for IMAP, and port 993 for a more secure IMAP connection.

You can craft a Lab Seeking Mechanism with 4 Dubious Plating and Mysterious Circuitry, and 10 Iron Bars, the combine it with 3 Vines to allow it to search for the jungle's lab.

Mostly unchanged in its first phase, the Phantasmal Deathray will swing faster than normal, and will allow the leach clots to heal <TerrariaText text='Moon Lord' moonlord/> more for a bit. The Phantasmal Spheres will also move slower initially but accelerate over time. The Phantasmal Eyes will also home in longer, and the hand's eyes will attempt to predict the player's movement when firing Phantasmal Rays. This can be easily exploited, if you run towards the eyes fast enough and stand next to them, they will aim away from you.""/><Paragraph text=""Once you defeat the eyes, they will spawn a True Eye of Cthulhu as usual, but the eye will stay in its socket. The true eye's no longer deal contact damage, but now you basically have double the projectiles to deal with, and the death ray won't go away.
